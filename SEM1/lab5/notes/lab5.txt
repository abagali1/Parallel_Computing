1. Initialize a grid M rows -by- N columns.

2. Each slot has a P% chance to be turned ON.

3. At time zero IGNITE the on-slots in the left column.

4. Then count the number of steps it takes to BURNOUT.

5. At each timestep spread to the four nearest neighbors.

6. Do not include diagonal neighbors.

7. Normalize the final count by dividing by the width.

8. Average the normalized burnout time over T trials.

9. Report M, N, T, delta P, np, and runtime.





10. What is the peak value?





11. Confirm AVG increases to peak then decreases.

12. Confirmation can be done on output data only.

13. Confirmation can be done with any language.

14. Find the peak value for all your other plots.
